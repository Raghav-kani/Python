# Outline of Projects

## Covid-19 

### 1.1	CONTEXT

The objective of this project is to analyze the circumstances of countries based on the number of people live, have died, or have been recovered in each nation. Check the pop test ratio for each nation.

### 1.2 PROJECT SCOPE

The project's scope is to analyze "Covid-19" affected people's data is from ‘Jan-2020 to July-2020’. 
Analyze the data who have been affected based on their country or region. 
To analyze the data, we used PYTHON-Jupiter note & Visual Studio code. 

The data are be visualized in a variety of charts. 
In this project, we can compare the number of actives, recoveries, deaths, and so on.

### 1.3 PROJECT GOAL

In this Insight, we looked at how situations in various countries compared.  
We may easily assess and compare data with the help of these.  
As a result of the project, we may learn about each country in different ways throughout six months.  

We can also look at each country's affected ratio to evaluate where death cases are few and recovery cases are high. 
The data was generated using Python and saved in table format (Pivot Table) in MS Excel, which is then formatted to a chart for better visibility and analysis.

## Finance 

### 2.1	CONTEXT

The project's hypotheses are that each ID will be analyzed based on prior data and each ID is classified into categories such as high income, experience, income, and so on

### 2.2 PROJECT SCOPE

The point of the project is to analyze finance analysis based on their revenue, securities account, and other factors. 
We'll look at how Personal Loans are determined by income in this financial examination. 
We'll figure out what a 'CD Account' is, as well as what a 'Personal Loan' is, and so on. It was investigated in a variety of methods. 
In this 'Analysis,' we used Python and MS EXCEL. For analyzing data from the provided table, Python is used. 

It lets us analyze a specific table or column from a table, as well as merge multiple tables into one. 
Tables and charts are used to visualize the individual ID derived data using Spyder-python and MS Excel.

### 2.3 PROJECT GOAL

The goal of the project is to evaluate individual financial data based on historical performance utilizing the data provided. 
Through this technique, we were able to get new data for a single ID from existing data. 
We use Python and various queries in this project to extract the most important facts from the given data. 
Python and MS Excel are also used to exhibit the data in the shape of tables and charts. 

A pivot table's main aim is to compare different ID from various perspectives. 
As a result of this analysis, we were able to see how each particular ID performed.
